I am mainly interested in **clinical psychology** and **decision neuroscience**. Particularly, I seek to understand the roles of stress in decision making and how they are implicated in certain psychiatric conditions using **neurocomputational** and **machine learning** approaches. I aim to become a scientist who builds tools that help people make better decisions in the realm of psychiatric issues. To this end, I am eager to combine computational modeling and neuroscience with clinical psychology.

## Projects
### *Acute stress alters Social discounting rate among males*
![image-left]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/project_1_socialdistance.png){: .align-left} **Acute stress alters Social discounting rate among males** is a project led with [Kunil Kim](http://socialdecisionneurosciencelab.org/people) (LSD lab). In this project, we aimed to check:
* **if cortisol is indeed a prosocial hormone** 
* **whether the prosocial behaviors would be amplified among the stressed males, even toward the distant others**.
* In this project, we tested various computational models and confirmed a winning model.
