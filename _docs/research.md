# Research Interests
I am mainly interested in **clinical psychology** and **decision neuroscience**. Particularly, I seek to understand the roles of stress in decision making and how they are implicated in certain psychiatric conditions using **neurocomputational** and **machine learning** approaches. I aim to become a scientist who builds tools that help people make better decisions in the realm of psychiatric issues. To this end, I am eager to combine computational modeling and neuroscience with clinical psychology.

# Research Projects
## Memory bias and greater preference for smoking-associated contexts in smokers under acute stress
Like most addictive substances, nicotine dependence and smoking addiction is also known for its high relapse rate. Here, stress is a huge risk factor of relapse and increased craving to smoke. Referring to the phrase of "chasing the first high", this project aimed to test the role of acute stress bringing up the drug-related memory, especially the rewarding ones and that would contribute to increased craving.

## Identifying phenotypes for body-image satisfaction and healthy outcome for obestiy: using machine-learning approach  
We recruited over 1,000 participants from 16 branches nationwide with [365mc clinic](http://eng.365mc.co.kr/main/index), which is a liposuction hospital located in South Korea. This project aimed to investigate the significant variables that predict successful weight loss or maintenance. The battery we applied includes computational tasks and models on mobile applications and traditional psychometric measures.

- Project led with [Kunil Kim](http://socialdecisionneurosciencelab.org/people) (LSD lab)  
- Aimed to check:    
    * **if cortisol is indeed a prosocial hormone**   
    * **whether the prosocial behaviors would be amplified among the stressed males, even toward the distant others**.
