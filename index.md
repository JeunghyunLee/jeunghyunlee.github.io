<br>I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://ccs-lab.github.io/" style="color: black">Computational Clinical Science Lab</a> (March 2022 - Present), majoring in clinical psychology. I received a Master's degree in Clinical Psychology from <a href="https://en.snu.ac.kr/index.html" style="color: black"> Seoul National University</a> in February, 2022.    
<br>
My research interests revolve around the fields of decision making neuroscience and computational psychiatry. Specifically in addiction, where drugs are powerful but not optimal rewards, I am interested in understanding drug-intake decisions from value based choice perspective. I also seek to understand the influence of motivational states on the decision making, such as how stress and craving levels shift values of different options and their neural correlates. Moreoever, I aim to identify effective and reliable predictors of real-life maladaptive decisions in addiction, utilizing naturalistic tasks and real-life data sampling.
