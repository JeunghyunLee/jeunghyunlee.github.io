I got to present my research (Title: *Computational markers of treatment outcomes in smoking cessation: a longitudinal EMA study in real-world clinical settings*) in the form of an oral talk at the 10th World Congress of Cognitive and Behavioral Therapies ([WCCBT](https://wccbt2023.org/)). Standing before a diverse audience of researchers, scholars, and experts in the field and walking through my project was a fascinating expereince. I eagerly look forward to future conferences, where I can continue to learn, grow, and make a positive impact in the global research community.
