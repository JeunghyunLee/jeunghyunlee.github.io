I have finished my life as an exchange student at **University of Hong Kong**. I took courses from the Department of Psychology:
* Biological Psychology  
* Fundamentals of social psychology   
* Introduction to counselling and therapeutic psychology  
* Perception  

I've been having such a great time with lovely friends all over the world, now leaving with unforgettable memories. Love you all! <3<3
