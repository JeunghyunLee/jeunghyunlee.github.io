The annual meeting of the Society of Biological Psychiatry was held in Hilton, New Orleans, LA. It lasted for four days with the general theme of *Positivity and Happiness in a Worrisome World*. 

I presented a poster titled [**Acute Stress Induces Memory Bias and Stronger Preference for Smoking-Associated Places in Smokers**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006322322003328?via%3Dihub) and it was fascinating to mingle with researchers from various fields including psychiatry, genetics, neuroscience, and biology.
