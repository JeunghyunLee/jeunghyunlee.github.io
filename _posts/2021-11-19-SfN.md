I gave a virtual poster presentation at [2021 Society for Neuroscience](https://www.sfn.org/meetings/neuroscience-2021). Title of the poster was *Investigating the role of associative memory in acute stress-induced relapse*. I wish it was held in-person to interact with others face-to-face, but still loved to take part in the huge conference for the first time!
