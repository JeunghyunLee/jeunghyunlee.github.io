I received a Master's degree in Computational & Clincial psychology from the Seoul National University (Feb 2022).   

I am planning to pursue my PhD in the [**Computational Clinical Science Laboratory**](https://ccs-lab.github.io/) with Dr. Ahn as an advisor. Looking forward for a few more exciting years with these amazing people!
