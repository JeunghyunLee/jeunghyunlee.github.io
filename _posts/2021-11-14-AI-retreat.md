![image-center]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post_2021_AIretreat.png ){: .align-center} I gave a poster presentation at 2021 AI retreat held by SNU [Artificial Intelligence Institute]. The event was held in-person and it was fun to mingle with researchers from various fields of industry (i.e., Naver CLOVA, Megazone, Kakao enterprise, LG CNS). Looking forward for active collaborations in the future!
