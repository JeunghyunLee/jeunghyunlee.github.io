In line with winning the award for the BCS Graduate student contest of research proposal, I gave a presentation at the Integrative Student Research Collaboration Symposium. The event was held online, via zoom, due to the pandemic situation. Still, it was great to get feedback for the project from lots of other professors coming from different domains.
