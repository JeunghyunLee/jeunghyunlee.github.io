I gave an introductory presentation of our CCS lab at the 2021 BCS open lab. The main purpose of the open lab event of the [SNU BCS](http://bcs.snu.ac.kr/) is to introduce each lab and to possibly connect with undergraduate students who are interested in admission to the department. Due to the pandemic situation of COVID-19, it was held online via zoom, but we could meet a lot of students and feel the passion and interest to the field.
