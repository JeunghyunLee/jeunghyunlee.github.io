**Abstract**  

In this study, we provide behavioral, computational, and neuroimaging evidence that social stress 25 enhances intuitive prosocial value processing while disrupting self-reward processing. When 26 deciding monetary rewards for people of varying social distances, participants who showed 27 elevated cortisol secretion after a social stress task were more likely to choose a 28 disadvantageous inequal option. Neuroimaging data revealed that participants who were more 29 likely to choose the disadvantageous inequal option exhibited an increase in the extent to which 30 the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) encoded other-regarding rewards, whereas the
31 dorsal mPFC showed a decrease in encoding. Mediation analyses revealed that both the ventral 32 and dorsal mPFC indirectly mediated the link between increased cortisol levels and the increased 33 likelihood of choosing a disadvantageous inequal option. Furthermore, the results of effective 34 connectivity analysis indicated that cortisol exerts an excitatory influence on the dorsal mPFC 35 (dmPFC) via the ventral striatum (VS), while simultaneously sending inhibitory signals to the 36 dorsal mPFC via the dorsal striatum (DS). These findings provide empirical evidence to help 37 clarify the ambiguity regarding the effects of stress on prosocial decisions, indicating that social 38 stress disrupts deliberative decision-making while simultaneously promoting intuitive prosocial 39 motivation through the differential modulation of hierarchically organized cortico-striatal loops.
