I received a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Psychology and Public Governance & Leadership from Korea University (Feb 2020). Now that graduating, it has been a great honor and pleasure to experience a lot with the greatest people on this campus! 

Also, I'm happy to announce that I'm joining the [**Computational Clinical Science Laboratory**](https://ccs-lab.github.io/) as a graduate student with Heesun and Hoyoung. Thank you all for the warmest greetings!
