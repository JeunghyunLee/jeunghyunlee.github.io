I served as a teaching assistant for the tutorials on [Reinforcement Learning/hBayesDM](https://github.com/CCS-Lab/hBayesDM) taught by [Young](https://ccs-lab.github.io/team/young-ahn/) at the [2022 Computational Psychiatry Course](https://www.translationalneuromodeling.org/cpcourse/) organized by the Translational Neuromodeling Unit (TNU), ZÃ¼rich. Thank you all for the interactive and fun course!
