I gave a presentation to the class of *Topics in Psycholoical Sciences (M1308.00160)*. The course normally invites experts from each field to hold seminars every week but once a year, graduate students are offered the opportunity to present about their latest research. This year, I am honored to have this opportunity and get to speak about myself and ongoing studies. Although I could only make it via Zoom because  I was visiting Indiana at this time, it was my pleasure to meet and talk to a few undergraduates and graduate students. 

Here are the [slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17-5ItrpaAQLVek6eCeTdrOydrUv1-vP5/view?usp=sharing) I used for the presentation!
