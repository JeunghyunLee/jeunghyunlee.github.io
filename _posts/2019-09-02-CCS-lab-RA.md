![image-right]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post_ccs-lab.png){: width="50%" height="50%"}{: .align-right} I have joined the [**Computational Clinical Science Laboratory**](https://ccs-lab.github.io/) as an undergraduate Research Assistant.  As a Research Assistant in the CCS Lab, I hope to learn about computational modeling and machine learning in depth by engaging in ongoing research projects.
