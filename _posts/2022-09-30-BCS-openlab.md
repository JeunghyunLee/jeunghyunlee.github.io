I attended *2022 Open lab Day* hosted by the Student Council of [Department of Brain & Cognitive Science ](http://bcs.snu.ac.kr/) of Seoul Natiinal University. This event invited undergraduate students who are interested in SNU BCS and aimed to open up discussion to help them find a lab that fits interests. As a graduate student in CCS-lab, I gave an introduction speech for those who were interested in the field. I also led an in-person tour in the MRI center where students could participate in fMRI scanning and tasks following the experiment protocol.
