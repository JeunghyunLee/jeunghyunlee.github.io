I visited [*Dr. Josh Brown*](https://psych.indiana.edu/directory/faculty/brown-joshua-w.html) and [*his lab*](https://ccsrv1.psych.indiana.edu/cclab/?_gl=1%2Abh6b2l%2A_ga%2AMTIxMTI4MzgxMi4xNjY0NTg4NTI2%2A_ga_61CH0D2DQW%2AMTY3MDA2NTM0NS45LjAuMTY3MDA2NTM0NS4wLjAuMA..) in Indiana University Bloomington, IND. Staying around for a week, I learned A-Z about the vaping device compatible within the MRI scanner, which was developed & customized in his lab. I am carrying this set of device to our research center for another stretch of work. Looking forward to see where this awesome collaboration is headed to, and, go Hoosiers!
