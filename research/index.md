<br>I am a graduate student in <a href="https://ccs-lab.github.io/" style="color: black">Computatinal Clinical Science Lab</a> in <a href="https://en.snu.ac.kr/index.html" style="color: black">Seoul National University</a>. I study computational psychiatry and decision neuroscience. My research investigates how people make maladaptive decisions under stress. To this end, I aim to bridge clinical science with neuroscience and data science. <br />

I am working in the following areas

* Software development and architecture with Java, JEE, web applications, Ruby / JRuby and web services including security
