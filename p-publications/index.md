* [**Poster**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006322322003328?via%3Dihub) presented at the 2022 Annual meeting of Society of Biological Psychiatry (New Orleans, LA)
* Like most addictive substances, nicotine dependence and smoking addiction is also known for its high relapse rate. Here, stress is a huge risk factor of relapse and increased craving to smoke. Referring to the phrase of "chasing the first high", this project aimed to test the role of acute stress bringing up the drug-related memory, especially the rewarding ones and that would contribute to increased craving. By investigating the process of which context memories are retrieved and preferred in episodes associated with cigarettes, we hope the findings to provide a deeper understanding of stress-induced relapse.

* We recruited over 1,000 participants from 16 branches nationwide with [365mc clinic](http://eng.365mc.co.kr/main/index), which is a liposuction hospital located in South Korea. This project aimed to investigate the significant variables that predict successful weight loss or maintenance. The battery we applied includes computational tasks and models on mobile applications and traditional psychometric measures.
