<br>I am a PhD student in <a href="https://ccs-lab.github.io/" style="color: black">Computatinal Clinical Science Lab</a> in <a href="https://en.snu.ac.kr/index.html" style="color: black">Seoul National University</a>. 
* I am mainly interested in **computational psychiatry** and **decision neuroscience**. 
* Particularly, I seek to understand the roles of stress in decision making and how they are implicated in certain psychiatric conditions using **neurocomputational** and **machine learning** approaches. 
* I aim to become a scientist who builds tools that help people make better decisions in the realm of psychiatric issues. 
* To this end, I am eager to combine computational modeling and neuroscience with clinical psychology. <br />
