<br>I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://ccs-lab.github.io/" style="color: black">Computatinal Clinical Science Lab</a> (March 2020 - Present). I am majoring in clinical psychology and received a Master's degree in Clinical Psychology from <a href="https://en.snu.ac.kr/index.html" style="color: black"> Seoul National University</a> in February, 2022.    
<br>
My research interests revolve around the fields of stress and its effects on decision-making in addiction. By combining computational modeling and neurocognitive approaches, I also seek to understand memory-guided decision-making and how they are implicated in psychiatric conditions such as substance use disorders. Moreoever, I aim to identify effective and reliable predictors of real-life maladaptive decisions in addiction, utilizing computational and physiological markers.
