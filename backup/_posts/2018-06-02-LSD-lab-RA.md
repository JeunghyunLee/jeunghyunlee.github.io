![image-right]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post_lsd-lab.png){: width="50%" height="50%"}{: .align-right} I joined the [**Laboratory of Social Decision Neuroscience**](http://socialdecisionneurosciencelab.org/) as an undergraduate Research Assistant. As a research assistant, I hope to engage in fMRI projects to learn how projects progress and gain insights for my own research ideas.
