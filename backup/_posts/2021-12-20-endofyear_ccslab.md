CCS Lab members gathered up for an end-of-semester lab party! We normally organize some activities but this year, due to a prolonged pandemic situation, we low-key prepared white elephant gifts for each other. Everyone brought both an white elephant and a needful gifts to put together in the middle, took turn to choose one each. Merry Christmas and Happy new year to everyone! <3
