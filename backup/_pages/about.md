## Hi!
{% include gallery id="layouts_gallery" %}
I am a graduate student at [**Computational Clinical Science Laboratory**](https://ccs-lab.github.io/) (PI: Woo-young Ahn). I received a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Psychology and Public Governance & Leadership from Korea University (Feb 2020).

## Research Interest
I am mainly interested in **clinical psychology** and **decision neuroscience**. Particularly, I seek to understand the roles of stress in decision making and how they are implicated in certain psychiatric conditions using **neurocomputational** and **machine learning** approaches. I aim to become a scientist who builds tools that help people make better decisions in the realm of psychiatric issues. To this end, I am eager to combine computational modeling and neuroscience with clinical psychology.

## Research Experience
### Research Assistant (Aug, 2019 ~ Feb, 2020):
I worked as a research assistant at **Computational Clincial Science Laboratory** (PI: Woo-young Ahn). I designed and led a neuroimaging project regarding effect of acute stress on decision making. Also, I engaged in a few ongoing fMRI projects in the lab.  

### Research Assistant (May, 2018 ~ Aug, 2019):
I worked as an undergraduate research assistant at  [**Laboratory of Social Decision Neuroscience**](http://socialdecisionneurosciencelab.org/) (PI: Hackjin Kim). I designed and led a fMRI project aiming to reveal neural mechanism of prosocial behavior under stress.  

### University of Hong Kong (Jan, 2018 ~ May, 2018):
I studied in [**University of Hong Kong**](https://www.hku.hk/) as an exchange student for a semester. I took courses from the Department of Psychology and also led a term project in Social Psychology (PSYC 2020).
